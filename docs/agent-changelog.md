# Agent Change Log

Generated by the AI coding agent on 2025-11-16.

This changelog summarizes all changes the agent made in this session so far.

## Summary

- Created a set of documentation TODOs to track work on Font Awesome selective registration, dependency upgrades, code-splitting, and build/test verification.
- Wrote and updated the repository TODO list via the task manager tool.
- Inspected repository files and Font Awesome package contents to identify where configuration changes should be applied (no source code edits made yet).

## Files Added

- `docs/fontawesome-todo.md`
  - Purpose: Plan specifically for replacing `library.add(fas, fab)` with selective Font Awesome icon registration.

- `docs/dependency-upgrades-todo.md`
  - Purpose: Checklist for finalizing frontend dependency upgrades (pinning, audits, lockfile updates, verification).

- `docs/code-splitting-todo.md`
  - Purpose: Checklist and guidance for applying `React.lazy` + `Suspense`, splitting vendor libraries, and measuring impact.

- `docs/build-test-todo.md`
  - Purpose: Commands and verification steps for local builds, tests, Go test matrix, and CI parity checks.

- `docs/agent-changelog.md` (this file)
  - Purpose: Human-readable summary of changes made by the agent during this session.

## Repository State Changes

- No source code files under `src/` were modified by the agent yet.
- The agent wrote/updated the in-repo TODO list via the internal task manager tool (noted in session history).

## Tools & Actions Used

- `manage_todo_list` tool: created and expanded an 8-item TODO list tracking the work items for this project.
- `create_file` tool: created the above `docs/*.md` files.
- `read_file` and `grep_search` (read-only): inspected `node_modules/@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons/index.mjs` to confirm icon exports and searched the workspace for icon usage patterns.

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Confirm you want me to start enumerating Font Awesome icons used in the app (I can then create a selective `registerFontAwesome.js` and wire it into `src/features/theme/DevToolsTheme.jsx`).
2. Alternatively, I can run a local build and record current bundle sizes to create a before/after comparison baseline.

If you'd like me to proceed with either, reply with one of: `icons`, `build`, or `pause`.

If you'd like this changelog expanded (add diffs, attach exact output from `npm run build`, or include the todo list contents inline), tell me which details to include and I'll update the file.
